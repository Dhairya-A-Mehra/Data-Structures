==> Call Stack: A stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including programming language, machine architecture, and amount of available memory.

==> Stack Overflow: occurs if the call stack exceeds the stack bound. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's bounds), the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash.
